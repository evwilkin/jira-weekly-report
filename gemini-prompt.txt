Run each comment summary through the weekly update outcome statement gem, and return a list of all issues with their title followed by bullet points with the link, a detailed summary of the issue comments, and the new outcome statement. Remove names from the outcome statements to focus on what was done rather than who did the work.

Add another bullet point titled "Executive Summary" that presents a more concise version of the outcome statement to make it presentable for an executive report while keeping the value delivered by each update highlighted.
